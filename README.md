ðŸ“¡ DCCN Cisco Packet Tracer Project

This project was created for the Data Communication and Computer Networking (DCCN) module. It demonstrates the design and simulation of a computer network using Cisco Packet Tracer.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

Designed and implemented a simulated network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Configured routers, switches, PCs, and servers to enable communication across the network.

Applied IP addressing, subnetting, and routing protocols.

Tested connectivity using ping and simulation mode.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

âœ… Structured network design following networking principles.

âœ… Subnetting to optimize IP address usage.

âœ… Configured static/dynamic routing for packet delivery.

âœ… Demonstrated LAN/WAN communication in the simulation.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies
